# website-refactor
refactoring of website along with fixing any links that arent working 

## index.html
inside of the html form i had added in changes to the original code by getting rid of a lot of the div tags and exchanging them with tags semantic tags that were more fitting for what the code was trying to do.

## CSS
in the css sheet i had changed moved some of the coding around so that there arent as many lines because i noticed some of the code toward the bottom had matched eachother so i put them togehter in groups. i also had changed the length of one of the boxes to make it longer and appear how it did in the example.
